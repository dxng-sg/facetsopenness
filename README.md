# facetsopenness
The R script and datasets in this repository were used for producing the results of my scoping review manuscript, where I look at the associations of different facets of openness with various indices of prejudice and tolerance. The R script was used to create forest plots, funnel plots, and generate various findings (like measures of heterogeneity and publication bias).

I will like to acknowledge Quintana (2015) for providing a easy to follow r script in the conduct of meta-analysis, which I have adapted in my own meta-analysis. 

As this is still a working repository, which means that it can be messy and hard to follow. The r script may be updated at a future date.
