# facetsopenness
This R script was used for meta-synthesizing the results of my scoping review manuscript, where we look at the associations of facets of openness with various indices of prejudice and tolerance. 
We will like to acknowledge Quintana (2015) for providing a easy to follow r script in the conduct of meta-analysis, which I have adapted in my own meta-analysis. 

As this is still a working file, which means that it can be messy and hard to follow. The r script may be updated at a future date.
